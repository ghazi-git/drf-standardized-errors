## Credits

This package was inspired by [DRF Exceptions Hog](https://github.com/PostHog/drf-exceptions-hog) but, with an emphasis
on the ability to customize the error response format to your liking while keeping the implementation of the exception
handler as close as possible to the original DRF implementation.
